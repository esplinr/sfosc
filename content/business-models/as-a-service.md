The As a Service model is when the software is released under an open source
license, and available for anyone to run, while also being made available As
a Service by the company. 

### Who Uses it?

* [Discourse](https://discourse.org)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)

### When should it be used?

When the software is primarily consumer oriented, or has a large operational
overhead. The goal here is that the software has the simplest on-ramp possible,
and requires no effort to maintain over time. 

### What kind of monetization is possible?

In its most pure form, such as Discourse, the software is always 100% free. That means
that, while there is often a single company offering it as a service, the community
itself is free to do so as well. 

In other cases, the software will be covered under an aggressive form of
copyleft, potentially combined with [dual licensing]({{% ref
"business-models/dual-licensing" %}}), or non-free licenses (such as the
[commons clause](https://commonsclause.com)) may be
used to create a monopoly on offering the software as a service.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Maybe. Discourse is an example of a sustainable community because the project is
financed by the service but any member of the community would be free to compete.
However, projects that protect the hosting organization from competition through a
[dual license model]{{{% ref "business-models/dual-licensing" %}}} are unlikely to
have sustainable open source communities due to the unequal participation between
the controlling entity and other collaborators. Such approaches do not adhere to the
sustainability principles that are advocated in [the core commitment]({{% ref "principles" %}}).
